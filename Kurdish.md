"Kurdish Reader. Modern Literature and Oral Texts in Kurmanji: With Kurdish-English Glossaries and Grammatical Sketch" seems like a good reader for when you get to a decent level, with lots of vocabulary and grammatical explanations.

"Kurdish Phrasebook and Culture" well - It's a phrasebook.


 * https://www.academia.edu/27750105/Kurmanji_Kurdish_For_The_Beginners_PDF : "Kurmanji Kurdish for Beginners". Written by professors from Harvard and Uppsala University


http://learnkurmanji.com
A great website to get you started in Kurmanji and for easily navigateable basic lessons about the language. They're constantly updating and have got a lot more lessons now than when I first got interested in Kurmanji, so this will probably by extensive in a few months/years :)

https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Kurmanji/ : Here's one of many links to "Kurmanji Kurdish: A Reference Grammar" by W.M. Thackston, one of the best scholars of Kurdish in the west, who has also written the Sorani grammar and reader that I referenced above. It is dense, but it seems VERY good for when you're at a higher-intermediate level :)

http://cls.arizona.edu/kur1/contents.htm
The Critical Language Series of Arizona University also has a course, it seems good, yet not something I'd use over the above, as it is mainly/only audio, I believe.

"Learn Kurdish: A Multi-Level Course in Kurmanji"
http://rojavaplan.com/uploads/kurdish/Learn_Kurdish.pdf
Seems like a good basic textbook to learn most things you'd need and more. It has a bit of an outdated structure, but it has a mass of information.

Last but not least, here's just a basic introduction, but worth posting nevertheless;
